Remember the good old days of arcade games? This is a of the classic Asteroids arcade game will take you back there instantly. 
You are a ship represented by the blue ship sprite icon and you must destroy as many asteroids as you can while avoiding enemy ships and of course the asteroids themselves.
 One good shot and you're toast so watch your back. Your ship has some really cool physics that take into account thrust, direction, and speed. 
 Use the W,A,S,D for movement and press space to fire. Best of luck!.
